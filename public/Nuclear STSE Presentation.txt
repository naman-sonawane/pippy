Before we get started...
What would you choose?
Attention grabber: Imagine it’s the year 2040. Your city announces that a new energy plant will be built two kilometres from your house. They give you two options and you have to choose.

B
A proven energy system that has powered cities for decades, but creates long-lasting radioactive waste.
B: A new advanced energy system that produces almost no long-term waste, but has never been used for large-scale electricity before.
As we go through this lesson, I want you to think about which option you trust more: proven experience or future potential

Fusion vs. Fission
What is it?

Nuclear Fission
noun • [noo-klee-ur-fi-shn]

Fission happens when a heavy nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei
This reaction releases energy and 2-3 neutrons
A controlled chain reaction allows reactors to generate electricity
Fission is used in nuclear power plants around the world today

Most common fuel: U-235
You can think about it how they are almost like opposites, where fusion joins 2 light nuclei, and fission breaks apart.
• These neutrons can hit other U 235 atoms and keep the chain reaction going
• This chain reaction is what makes nuclear power plants work

1.
Splitting the nucleus releases a large amount of energy
2.
Most energy appears as kinetic energy of the products
3.
This kinetic energy becomes heat inside the reactor
Nuclear Fission
Heat is used to boil water and spin turbines.
Why Fission Releases Energy

Slow vs. Fast
Slow Neutrons
Fast Neutrons
Pressurized or boiling water slows down fast neutrons so they become usable.
Cause most fission in power reactors
Come directly from fission and move quickly
U 235 is thermally fissile and naturally occurring.
Nuclear Fission

 
• Many possible fission products exist
• Reaction equations always conserve total protons + neutrons
• Products include smaller nuclei plus energy
• Smaller nuclei further undergo radioactive decay until stability
• Most energy becomes heat used for electricity
(World Nuclear Association, 2025)
Nuclear Fission

Nuclear
Fusion

Nuclear Fusion
noun • [noo-klee-ur-fyoo-zhn]

• Fusion combines two light nuclei into a heavier nucleus.
• Releases massive energy (powers the Sun)
• Considered one of the most promising clean energy sources.
• New breakthroughs such as high-field compact reactors at MIT show progress toward stable, net-positive fusion.

Experimental!!


• Requires extremely high temperatures and pressures to overcome repulsion between nuclei.
• Tokamaks use magnetic fields to confine hot plasma
• Laser fusion uses high-power lasers to compress fuel
• REBCO superconducting magnets handle intense heat + radiation while keeping plasma stable
(Reis et al., 2025)

Most studied reaction
D + T → He + n + Energy 
Nuclear Fusion

1.
When light nuclei fuse, the mass of the final nucleus is slightly lower.
2.
The missing mass (neutrons + heat) becomes energy.
3.
Recreated on Earth using magnets or lasers.
Nuclear Fusion
E = mc2
Why Fusion Releases Energy

Technology Essentials
Tokamaks
• Donut-shaped reactor
• Strong magnetic fields confine plasma
Laser Fusion
• Lasers rapidly compress fuel pellets
Advanced Materials
• REBCO superconductors allow stronger magnetic fields
• Must survive intense neutron radiation and heat
(Reis et al., 2025)

Comparing
Impacts

Impacts on Society
Radiation & Nuclear Waste
• Fission creates radioactive products, including long lived fission products (LLFPs).
• LLFPs can harm human health in high doses.
• A management method is transmutation, where waste is allowed to decay and then used in fast reactors to reduce its lifetime.
 
(World Nuclear Association, 2024; Kailas et al., 2015)
Energy Supply & Benefits
• Nuclear energy provides about 15% of Canada’s electricity.
• Oakville gets almost 50% of its power from nuclear.
• Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) enforces strict safety rules at all plants.
• New nuclear projects are being explored as clean energy options.
 
      (Oakville Hydro, 2024; Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, 2025)

Nuclear Fission

Impacts on Society
Economic & Technological Impact
• Could supply near-unlimited, stable, carbon-free power.
• May reduce electricity costs and global reliance on fossil fuels.
(HowStuffWorks, 2021)
• Fusion development creates thousands of high-tech jobs and pushes innovation in magnet design, plasma physics, and materials.
(World Economic Forum, 2025)
Global Collaboration & Ethics
• Global projects like ITER unite many countries in shared scientific and climate goals.
(World Economic Forum, 2025)

• Ethical frameworks needed to ensure equitable access to fusion energy worldwide.
(Scientific American, 2025)
Nuclear Fusion
International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor

Climate & Air Quality
Mining & Land Impact
• Nuclear power directly releases zero CO2 during operation.
• Prevents about 470 million metric tons of CO2 globally each year.
• Also reduced NOx and smog compared to fossil fuels

(United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, n.d.; Nuclear Energy Institute, n.d.)

• Uranium mining and enrichment are required for nuclear fuel.
• Some mines become abandoned (over 4,000 abandoned uranium mines exist in the U.S.)
• These can contaminate nearby water with radioactive material, which can harm ecosystems and increase risks like bone cancer.
 
(Stanford Energy, 2025; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2025)

Environmental Impact
Nuclear Fission
Mention that what comes out of the cooling towers is actually water steam, not CO2

Material Requirements
Radioactive Waste
• Fusion reactors need rare, specialized materials (superconductors, special alloys).
• Mining + manufacturing these materials can cause emissions and ecosystem disruption.
(EBSCO, 2024; National Academy of Engineering, 2024)
• Fusion produces no long-lived high-level waste like fission.
• Reactor components become activated by neutron exposure → need storage for 50–100 years, then decay to safe levels.
(IPP, 2022; ITER, 2024)
• Recycling of activated materials is being developed but faces regulatory + public acceptance challenges.
